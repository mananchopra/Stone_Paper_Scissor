This Application is created by using HTML/CSS and JavaScript. It allows you to play rock-paper-scissor with computer which generates events randomly. I have created two html pages.
One is the opening game page which allows you to start the game. The other page is for when the game starts. I have add some animations on the images via Java Scipt to make the game 
look more cooler. I have provided button rock, paper, scissor through which player can choose how does he wants to play. The scores keep get updated on the column of player and 
computer provided above. It keeps the track of the score. It is a simple game which I made to to show my HTML/CSS and Java Script knowledge.
